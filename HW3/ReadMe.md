**Perl and Dynamic Scoping**

*Introduction*
<pre>
The assignment focuses on dynamic and static scoping.
To experience both the programming flexibility and readability (good or bad) with dynamic scoping,
there are three tasks required.

Task1:
A game called "Golden Hook Fishing" is implemented in Perl, 
with the specific OO design described in the pdf.

Task2:
"Monopoly" game is implemented in Perl.
The benefit of dynamic scoping will be experienced.

Task3:
Implement the "Monopoly" game in python with the exactly same class design as task 2.
 
*The discussion is in the report
and the implementation details are in the pdf.
