**An Implementation of a TA ranking system in COBOL and C**

*Aim:*
<pre>
1. Compare the conveniences and difficulties between C and COBOL.
2. Compare COBOL with modern programming languages from different aspects,
    e.g. variable declarations, paradigm, data type, parameter parsing
3. Learn to justify the programming difficulty and efficiency due to a language.
4. Learn to separate tasks into submodules.

*The discussion is written in the report.pdf.
